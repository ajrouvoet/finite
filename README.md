# Finite

This is a small library for working with finite sets, based on some of the constructs in [\[1\]][1]: a set is considered finite if there's a list that can be shown to contain all of its elements. A form of the finite pigeonhole theorem is implemented in [`Finite.Pigeonhole`](src/Finite/Pigeonhole.agda) (with code based on [\[2\]][2]): any vector with elements drawn from a finite set that's longer than the total size of the set must have at least one element at two different indices.

# How to build
Building requires the [Agda standard library](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib) to be installed and associated with the name `standard-libarary` in an Agda [`defaults` file](http://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.5.3/tools/package-system.html).
